# Housing-Prices-Predictions


## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

This project represents my **second step in learning machine learning models**, focusing on key concepts such as **validation**, **overfitting**, and **underfitting**. The competition involves predicting the final prices of houses based on various features.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned to:
- Use **validation data** to evaluate model performance.
- Identify and mitigate issues related to **overfitting** and **underfitting**.
- Train and fine-tune a **Random Forest Regressor** for better predictions.

## Approach
- Split the dataset into training and validation sets to monitor model performance.
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor using selected features.
- Tuned the model to balance underfitting and overfitting for improved accuracy.
- Generated a final prediction file for submission.

## Files
- `notebook.ipynb`: The main notebook containing data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
- `submission.csv`: The final submission file containing predictions for the test dataset.
